The most exciting part of the project is to run the application. So, open the Docker window and run the following command: 

 

docker run -i --name ztev-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=ztev -p 5432:5432 --rm postgres

 

Let’s breakdown the command to understand it better.

 

‘Docker run’ starts the container.

‘-i’ refers to interactive mode.

‘--name’ gives a name to the container.

‘-e’ is an environment variable that you are passing. For example, here, the password is being provided and the database that needs to be initialised is being specified.

‘-p’ refers to port mapping, which specifies the container port that you want to map to your host.

‘--rm’ ensures that the container is deleted on pressing ‘ctrl + c’.

 

Open two terminals, one for the client and one for the server. Navigate inside the client and the server directories of both the terminals. Run ‘app.py’ in both the terminals.
